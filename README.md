By Carolie Delisle & Jennifer Brown
Concordia University Fall 2023 | CART 410

Inspired by speculative evolution, BOTANOID SYNTHETICA is a plant-machine hybrid. 
Communicating via touch and light, BOTANOID consists of a base of living plants, equipped with capacitive touch sensing.
Emerging from its base is a flower-like shade; 3D printed and embedded with imagery.
Upon touch, the BOTANOID reacts with various light activations. 

BOTANOID SYNTHETICA is displayed suspended, spanning 2.5 cupic feet.
Exhibited with CART 410 on December 6, 2023.

More to come.
